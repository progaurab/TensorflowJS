# TensorflowJS

JavaScript developers can use the TensorFlow framework to create a machine learning (ML) project. This course introduces you to ML basics, and demonstrates how to set up and use TensorFlow to train a model and generate live results. Emmanuel Henri shows how to create a new project; how to work with different tensor types, variables, models, and layers; how to import a project and explore datasets; how TensorFlow executes model training; how to convert a saved model for the web; and more.
